# Post-Op Hip Recovery — 3-Day Gym Program

**Context:** Right hip posterior labral repair (Dec 2, 2025). ~2.5 months post-op. PT ongoing.  
**Restrictions:** No deep squats yet. Limit right-over-left crossing (adduction past midline). Internal rotation still stiff — avoid loading it. Progress ROM gradually.  
**Schedule:** 3 days/week (e.g., Mon / Wed / Fri), 45–60 min sessions.  
**Goal:** Rebuild functional lower body strength, stability, and endurance for skiing, volleyball, skating, and long-distance walking.

## Structure Overview

| Day | Focus | Theme |
|-----|-------|-------|
| **Day 1** | Lower Body Strength + Core | Bilateral machine work, controlled loading |
| **Day 2** | Posterior Chain + Back | Hip hinge patterning, back extension progression, core |
| **Day 3** | Stability & Unilateral + Core | Balance, single-leg strength, anti-rotation core |

Every session follows the same template:
1. **PT Warm-Up / Activation** (~10 min)
2. **Main Block** (~35–40 min)
3. **Cooldown** (~5 min — gentle stretching, no aggressive hip stretches)

---

## PT Warm-Up Block (Every Session)

Do these before every gym session. You already know the movements — this is your neural wake-up call for the hip.

- **Banded clamshells** (side-lying) — 15 each side
- **Banded fire hydrants** — 15 each side
- **Banded monster walks** — 20 steps each direction
- **Side-lying straight leg lift** — 15 each side
- **Single-leg balance hold** (opposite knee to 90°) — 30 sec each side

*~10 minutes. Increase reps/hold times as these get easy, but don't rush — this is activation, not fatigue.*

---

## Day 1 — Lower Body Strength + Core

**The idea:** Build load tolerance through stable, bilateral, machine-guided movements. Machines control the path of motion so you can focus on muscular effort without worrying about stabilization demands you're not ready for yet.

### Main Block

**Leg Press** (machine, bilateral)
- 3 × 12–15 reps
- Start at or near your current PT weight (~125 lb) and find a comfortable working weight
- Foot placement: moderate width, feet slightly high on the platform to reduce deep hip flexion
- Depth: only as deep as comfortable — probably stopping well above 90° at the hip for now
- *Progression: add 5–10 lb when all 3 sets of 15 feel controlled*

**Leg Press** (single leg)
- 2 × 10–12 each leg
- Lighter than bilateral — start around where your PT has you (~75 lb range)
- Right leg may need less weight or fewer reps — that's fine, just log it

**Leg Curl Machine** (seated or lying — whichever feels better on the hip)
- 3 × 12–15 reps
- Start light. Hamstrings are critical for hip stability and ski readiness but likely very weak right now
- *This is isolated hamstring work — no hip stress*

**Hip Abduction Machine**
- 3 × 15 reps
- Light to moderate — this reinforces all the banded glute work but under more consistent load
- Controlled on the return (don't let it slam shut)

**Goblet Squat** (kettlebell, partial ROM)
- 2 × 12–15 reps
- Start with the 20 lb KB you've been using
- Depth: only go as deep as you can while maintaining control and zero pain — think half-squat for now
- Heels slightly elevated on a plate if that helps (mirrors your PT narrow-stance setup)
- *Progression: deepen ROM before adding weight*

### Core (pick 2)

**Dead Bugs**
- 3 × 8 each side
- Keep low back pressed into the floor. Slow and controlled — this is anti-extension core stability
- *If the hip flexor demand on the right side is too much with full leg extension, keep that knee bent*

**Pallof Press** (cable machine or band)
- 3 × 10 each side
- Anti-rotation. Stand perpendicular to cable, press handle straight out from chest, hold 2 sec, return
- Light resistance — this is about resisting rotation, not pushing weight

---

## Day 2 — Posterior Chain + Back

**The idea:** Develop the hip hinge pattern and posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, spinal erectors). This is where skiing power comes from. The back extension progression starts here on day one.

### Main Block

**Back Extension Chair — Iso Hold Progression** *(from LowBackAbility)*
- **Starting point:** Hold at the top position (body in line with legs) for time
- **Week 1–2 target:** 3 holds, building toward 30–45 sec each
- **Week 3–4 target:** Build to 3 × 60 sec
- **Then:** Begin lowering the body angle (partial range holds), eventually moving to reps
- *Log your hold times every session — this is your primary back progression metric*

**Kettlebell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)**
- 3 × 10–12 reps
- Start with 20 lb KB, both hands
- This is a hip hinge learning movement — push hips back, slight knee bend, feel hamstrings and glutes load
- Only go as low as you can maintain a neutral spine and feel no hip pinching
- *Progression: deepen the hinge before adding weight*

**Glute Bridge** (on floor, progressing to hip thrust)
- 3 × 15 reps
- Bodyweight to start. Squeeze glutes hard at the top, hold 2 sec
- Both feet on ground (bilateral) — add single-leg version once you're hitting 3 × 15 easily
- *Progression path: BW bilateral → BW single leg → weighted bilateral (barbell or DB on hips)*

**Leg Curl Machine**
- 3 × 12–15 (same as Day 1 — hammering hamstrings twice a week is appropriate here)

**Farmer's Carry**
- 3 × 30–40 sec walks (or ~30 yards)
- Moderate weight kettlebells or dumbbells, one in each hand
- Walk with deliberate, even steps — this builds grip, core bracing, and hip stability under load while walking
- *Great carryover to long-distance walking tolerance*

### Core (pick 2)

**Bird-Dog**
- 3 × 8 each side, hold top position 3 sec
- Anti-extension + anti-rotation. Complements the back extension work

**Side Plank**
- 3 × 20–30 sec each side
- Modified from knees if needed — build toward full side plank from feet
- Lateral core stability is critical for skiing and cutting movements

---

## Day 3 — Stability & Unilateral + Core

**The idea:** Challenge balance, proprioception, and single-leg strength. This is the most sport-specific day — skiing, volleyball, and skating all demand single-leg stability under dynamic conditions. Keep loads modest; the instability IS the stimulus.

### Main Block

**Balance Board Squats** (RevBalance 101 v2)
- 3 × 12–15 reps
- 20 lb KB goblet hold (your current setup)
- If the gym doesn't have your board, do these on a BOSU ball (flat side up) or simply as slow single-leg partial squats on flat ground
- *Progression: add weight only when balance feels automatic*

**Step-Ups** (low box — start at 6–8 inches)
- 3 × 10 each leg
- Bodyweight or light DB hold (10–15 lb each hand)
- Drive through the heel of the working leg. Don't push off the back foot
- *This is unilateral quad/glute in a functional pattern. Box height increases over time — no rush*

**Cable Hip Abduction** (standing, ankle cuff)
- 2 × 12–15 each leg
- Light weight — this is a stability challenge as much as a strengthening one
- Stand tall, don't lean away from the cable

**Cable Hip Extension** (standing, ankle cuff, kick back)
- 2 × 12–15 each leg
- Light. Glute focused — squeeze at the top, don't hyperextend the low back
- *Avoid any cable exercises that pull the right leg into adduction past midline*

**Single-Leg Calf Raise** (on a step)
- 3 × 15 each leg
- Bodyweight. Full range — drop heel below the step, rise to full extension
- Calf/ankle strength matters for skiing boots and landing mechanics

### Core

**Pallof Press with Step** (cable or band)
- 3 × 8 each side
- Same as Day 1 Pallof but add a lateral step away from the anchor while holding the press — increases demand

**Dead Bug** (slow tempo)
- 3 × 8 each side
- 3 seconds to extend, 3 seconds to return. Builds time under tension for deep core endurance

## Progression Philosophy

The priority order for progressing any exercise:

1. **Form & control** — Can you do it without compensation patterns or pain?
2. **Range of motion** — Deepen the movement before loading it
3. **Reps / time** — Build volume at the current weight
4. **Load** — Add weight in small increments only after 1–3 are solid

**Practical rule:** If you can complete all prescribed sets and reps with good form and no pain for **two consecutive sessions**, you're ready to progress that exercise (add ROM, reps, or weight depending on where you are).

**When in doubt, stay where you are for another session.** You have months ahead — there's no week where you need to force a jump.

## Weekly Rhythm Example

| Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Day 1 | Rest / walk | Day 2 | Rest / walk | Day 3 | Active (hike, swim, etc.) | Rest |

Rest days aren't inactive — walking is encouraged and great for the hip. Easy bike riding (stationary or outdoor) is also excellent low-impact cardio when you're ready to add it.

---

## Notes

- **Log everything.** Weight, reps, sets, how it felt, any pain or tightness. This data becomes the foundation for your fitness app later and helps you (and your PT) track progression objectively.
- **Pain is a signal, not a challenge.** Sharp pain = stop. Dull muscular fatigue = good. "Weird feeling in the hip" = reduce load/ROM and reassess.
- **Talk to your PT** about this plan. They know your specific surgical repair and can flag anything they'd modify. Bring this to your next session.
- **Re-evaluate every 4 weeks.** That's when we can swap exercises, adjust volume, or introduce new movements as your capacity grows.
- **Cardio:** Stationary bike and swimming/pool walking are your best friends for building cardio back without hip stress. Add these on rest days when you feel ready.
